Generated: 2026-01-21T18:34:27.605Z

## Overview

- **Type**: OLTP
- **WASM Required**: Yes
- **Description**: Full PostgreSQL via PGLite WASM (~13MB)

## Cold Start

| Operation | P50 (ms) | P75 (ms) | P99 (ms) | ops/sec | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| postgres cold start | 600 | 720 | 1500 | 2 | 10 |

## Warm Query

| Operation | P50 (ms) | P75 (ms) | P99 (ms) | ops/sec | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| postgres pointLookup | 0.250 | 0.300 | 0.625 | 4K | 100 |
| postgres rangeScan | 1.80 | 2.16 | 4.50 | 556 | 100 |
| postgres count | 1.20 | 1.44 | 3.00 | 833 | 100 |

## Hot Cache

| Operation | P50 (ms) | P75 (ms) | P99 (ms) | ops/sec | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| postgres hot lookup | 0.002 | 0.002 | 0.004 | 500K | 10000 |

## Financial

| Operation | P50 (ms) | P75 (ms) | P99 (ms) | ops/sec | Samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| postgres createAccount | 0.800 | 0.960 | 2.00 | 1K | 100 |

## Strengths

- **Full SQL**: Complete PostgreSQL compatibility
- **ORM Support**: Works with existing PostgreSQL tooling

## Weaknesses

- **Cold Start**: WASM loading adds latency on first request
- **Bundle Size**: Larger download for users
- **WASM Size**: ~13MB PGLite WASM

## Recommended Use Cases

- Applications requiring full SQL
- Existing PostgreSQL codebases
- Complex joins and transactions
